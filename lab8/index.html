  <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
  <p>Experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>It was hard to think of a different example from the professor's picture
  on the lab 8 module and try to figure out how to execute it. I picked a very
simple idea of dividing my array in half.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>I couldn't figure out how to get the results from my script to show up
  on my index.html without having to view it in the console.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Go to the console to see the results.</p>
