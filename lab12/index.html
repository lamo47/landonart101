  <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
  <p>Create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>My main challenges with this lab were learning to write new functions in
    the conditional format and with expressions. Using all the new symbols and
    returns like "else if" took some getting used to. I also struggled with
    understanding how the modulus operator worked even though it was a simple
    code, I struggled with grasping the content.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>I ran into a lot of problems with working on this lab and ended up referring
  to the professors examples on the module quite a bit. I didn't know how to make
the function return different conditionals about the string. I also struggled with
the formating of the output for awhile and didn't know how to make it appear next
to the input form but I did some extra work in css to make it a seperate thing.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I think my results are very good! The input form and button are working
  properly and giving a conditional return that is one of the four options I named.
