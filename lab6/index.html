		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data
			types and variables to create an array.</p>
		<h2>Challneges</h2>
		<p>There was not a lot of challenges with this lab I just had to
				catch up late because I couldn't find a partner in time so I
				had to struggle on my own to figure it out.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>At first I couldn't figure out how to get the JavaScript console
			to recognize my arrays when I tried to do the console.log but I
			re-did everything and it worked.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I think the lab went relatively smoothly without the assistance
			of a partner but, here, look for yourself	at this index.html file
			I created:
		<div>
			<h3>Script Output</h3>
			<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
		</div>
