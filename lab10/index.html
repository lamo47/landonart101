  <h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
  <p>Experiment with JavaScript events.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>It was really hard trying to get all of these functions to work out together
  through JavaScript. I was a bit confused and had to work through it multiple
times to see why the array sort wasn't compatible with my inputs. I had to keep
looking at the lecture slides as well as lab 7 to figure out how to make them
work together for this lab.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>Most of my problems came with trying to copy code from lab 7 and the lecture
  and not realizing my labels weren't lining up and having to go back to make sure
  all the functions were calling for the right elements. Rewriting the array function
  wasn't that bad but trying to combine them with the getElementById took me a couple
  tries. The part I stuggled with the most for some reason was getting the sorted
  value to appear where my output was. I don't know why I thought I was doing it just
  how I did in lab9 but it took awhile for it to appear on my html.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Here are my results of a successful input form, try it out for yourself and
  look at the console to see whats happening behind the scenes:</p>

  <input type="text" id="user-name">
  <button id="my-button">Input Your Name</button>
  <div id="output"></div>
</div>
  </body>
</html>
