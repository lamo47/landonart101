  <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
  <p>Experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>This lab was really hard. I struggled with finding an api that was secure
  or would work with my JS file for awhile. I followed all the instructions
through the AJAX slide lecture and what we went over in class with practicing
with the numbers api and I was able to get it to work but when I tried doing
the same things with the new api's on the lab page they were not working and I
kept running into errors. The farthest I got was getting the yesorno api to
display the data on my index.html but it wasn't properley displaying the function
of the api and just showed all the information as text. I ended up just following
along with the cat api example the professor used in class and scratched my original
attempts, but I included them into my google doc submition.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>I didn't understand at first how the information from the slides lectures
  transfered over to work for the tasks for this lab. I couldn't understand what
to fill out for the different sections like data and stuff. Once I was able to
call for the api however, I still wasn't able to get it to display on my
index.html. I didn't understand if it was because the sites I was finding weren't
secure and how to fix that or if they needed to be in jSON or not. With the
yesorno api I couldn't get the different data information to load at all, it
would either print the entire website information without the image or gif or it
wouldn't display anything at all.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Here are my results with calling for the cat api that displays a new cat
  picture everytime you click my button. You can check out the console and see
whats going on in the background and try out my button below for yourself:</p>

  <button id="activate">Catify</button>
  What cat are you?
