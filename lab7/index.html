  <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
  <p>Writing functions that take user input.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>My only challenges were still being behind and not working with a partner.
    I hope to be caught up by this week and start working on track. I couldn't
    figure out how to add the image of the name tag and get my name on top of it.
    I also struggled with trying to do an original function so I did just do the
    same script as shown on the lab 7 module.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>Learning how to use the functions in JavaScript was hard and it took me
    awhile to get it to work.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Here is my index.html file you're viewing right now. Here is a link to my
    JS program execution:</p>
  <div>
    <h3>Script Output</h3>
