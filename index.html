	<h1> Landon Wells </h1>
	<div>
		<p>My name is Landon Wells and I am an art student at the University of Califonia Santa Cruz and I'm studying to become an animator.
			I like to paint with oils and listen to music. I also enjoy skateboarding and playing video games. I was born in the San Diego area
		and raised nearby in the suburbs of Temecula. I moved here in 2021 and I'm now 22 years old in my senior year and am excited to begin
	my creative career. I ultimately want to write and create my own animated short film and telivision series in order to show off my artwork
and create my own stories.</p>
