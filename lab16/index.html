  <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
  <p>Experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>This lab wasn't too hard because it was very similar to lab 15 so I was
  able to work through it with what I had already learned. It was challenging to
get this new api working by myself though with no direct example and just having
to apply the code from different examples in lecture to this specific api. I also
ran into the problem of having the CORS error that was blocking my information
from being displayed and didn't realize how simple it was to fix for awhile.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>Some problems I ran into in this lab were having the CORS error and having
  to get the chrome extension to unblock it so my api data would display properly.
I also struggled with rewriting the JS code because it was a little different
from the last lab and I couldn't figure out how to make it work with the comicObj
thing from the lab module so I just used jquery to call for my output and append
and display the different pieces of data. I also couldn't figure out how to create
the different functions to have it move through the different comics with the next
and previous buttons so I just stuck with displaying the one comic, its title,
and description.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Here are my results, you can test out the button for yourself and it will
  display the comic of the day from the xkcd api and you can check the console
to see what is going on in the background:</p>
  </div>
  <button id="activate">Fetch Data</button>
  What is today's comic?
  <div id="output"></div>
