  <h1>Lab 11: Libraries & jQuery</h1>
  <p>Experiment with jQuery.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <button id="button1">Challenges</button>
  <div class="challenges">
    I had a lot of challenges with this lab. For some reason I had to keep reloading
    my code and typing everything from scratch. Whenever I tried using templates
    from previous labs like for the index.html or even just the JS comment block
    the elements wouldn't change color and I was just typing without any effect.
    I reloaded and typed everything over and got it to work but I was still confused
    on how to make buttons for each section. I didn't get too creative with the buttons
    and just made the functions bring up an alert that had new text like labs before.</div>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <button id="button2">Problems</button>
  <p>I didn't know how to make the buttons work seperately so when you press the
  first button, it runs through the eventlistener functions of all the buttons. I
couldn't figure out how to make it so you could click each button individually and
have it's own output so for now if you click any button it will run all of them as
well as the special class change at the end. </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <button id="button3">Results</button>
  <p>I think my results were pretty good, I was able to add working buttons to
  all 3 sections of my index.html that you can try out here on the browser. They
all work and have an alert pop-up that says something else and I also was able to
change the class special of a div that I used for my challenges section. You can
test out all the buttons here and see what happens at the end with the special class
toggle as well as check out whats going on in the console:</p>
