  <h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
  <p>Experiment with DOM manipulation</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>It was hard at first trying to fetch an element, I should have included a
  picture or something like on the example with the professors homepage. So I
ended up just putting the blank div and labeled it output so I coulf refference
it and manipulate it later in JS.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>I kept having problems with organizing my JavaScript file and would try to
  call for different elements but forgot to reference them specifically like
1El, or 2El, so I didn't understand why I wasn't getting results for awhile. I
also could not get the style of the color to change for me when I tried changing
the css in my JS file I was only able to adjust the position and margin.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>You can see my results here, to the right are some of the elements I changed
  in JavaScript. I also added a button just to experiment that you can test, and
you can look at the console for yourself!</p>
