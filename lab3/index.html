	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>For this lab we had to create a local file structure and add index.html files.
		We created a homepage for ourselves with a picture and a list of our labs.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I really fell behind and didn't understand any of this and also didn't find a
		partner in time to help me through it. At first I thought I could just struggle
		through it on my own but had to email the professor and he said I can come back to
		labs 3-4 once I figure it out.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>I think after finally figuring it out I made a pretty good file structure:</p>
