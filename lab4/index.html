	<h1>Lab 8: Pseudocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
	<p>Getting in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before coding.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>It was pretty difficult for me to try and go back to this lab without a partner
		and try to figure it out with no examples. It seemed not too difficult of a
		lab but I had a hard time following the instructions alone without the screenshot
		examples on the lab module. Because I was confused and didn't know how to make
		the code on my own for my own idea, I just used the same idea and list as the
		example did with the tic-tac-toe.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>There wasn't a lot of big problems I had with this lab because I just did the
		same list as the example on the instructions and followed the lecture. I'm not
		completley confident however that I completed all the tasks as they were
		supposed to be done because I didn't completley understand the instructions.
		Maybe I'm just overthinking it though, and it really was just supposed to
		be a simple list. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here are my lists and code:</p>
	<div class="lists">
		<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe List</h3>
		<ol>

			<li>Print the board before each turn</li>
			<li>Accept user input</li>
			<li>Validate user move</li>
			<li>Evaluate possible moves</li>
			<li>Choose computer move</li>
			<li>Test for Win! condition</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>How to have fun List</h3>
		<ol>

			<li>Buy beer</li>
			<li>Buy food and snacks</li>
			<li>Invite your friends over</li>
			<li>Find a movie</li>
			<li>Drink the beer</li>
			<li>Eat and watch movie</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Code</h3>
<pre><code>
	// Print the board before each turn
	  // Loop through each row
	    // Loop through each space
	      // Print X, O, or space
	      // Print a | between
	    // Print a newline at the end
	    // Print a horizontal line between
