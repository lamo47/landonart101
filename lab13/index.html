  <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
  <p>Experiment with loops.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>This was for sure the most challenging lab I have done thus far. Figuring
  out the loop wasn't that hard in the console I was able to get it to list the
numbers and the according phrase (fizz, buzz etc.). I had a hard time however
linking that function to my html page and getting it to display and run on the
page not just the console.</p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>The looping list was easy but I struggled at first to get the function to
  work in order to change the output to the different phrases. I also didn't know
how to get the function to work on my index.html page and actually run based on
the input form. I also couldn't figure out how to format the output correctly in
css to make it all show across the screen so it's just listed straight down and
looks kind of bad.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Here are my results, you can try it out for yourself with you're own inputs.
  You just have to set a maximum and have an input of at least one factor and
what it prints. You can also check out the console to see whats happening in the
background.</p>
</div>
<div>
  Where should we stop? <input type="number" min=0 max="200" id="max"><br>
  Which factors should print what?<br>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Factor</th>
      <th>Prints what?</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><input type="number" min=0 max="23" id="num0"></td>
      <td><input type="text" id="text0"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><input type="number" min=0 max="23" id="num1"></td>
      <td><input type="text" id="text1"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><input type="number" min=0 max="23" id="num2"></td>
      <td><input type="text" id="text2"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><input type="number" min=0 max="23" id="num3"></td>
      <td><input type="text" id="text3"></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <button id="submit">Run</button>
