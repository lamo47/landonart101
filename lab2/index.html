<h1>Hello world</h1>
</div>
<p>My partner is Landon he has been told he is a Gemini but he doesn't know for sure.He is a studio art major and his favorite fruit is mango. It is mango because it's really good and a task to eat it. Men love tasks and I think that is funny. He also thinks girls are dumb for liking animals.</p>
<p>My partner is Million and she is a textbook aquarius. She is a third year creative writing major going to school to write on the back of cereal boxes, and she can make balloon animals. Girls like animals I guess. I do not think they are dumb.
